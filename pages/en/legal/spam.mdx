# Anti-Spam Policy

_Last updated: October 18, 2025_

## 1. Definition of Spam

At Kroescontrol, we apply a clear principle:

> **Spam is consent, not content.**

This means: **any electronic message** sent **without prior consent** from the recipient is spam, regardless of the content.

### Examples

**‚úÖ NOT spam (with consent):**
- Marketing email to customer who gave opt-in
- Newsletter to registered subscribers
- Transactional emails (order confirmations, password resets)
- Follow-up email after explicit consent

**‚ùå IS spam (without consent):**
- Cold emails to purchased email lists
- Bulk emails without opt-in
- Marketing to recipients who didn't give consent
- Religious, political, or cultural mass emails without consent

**It doesn't matter:**
- Whether the content is commercial, informational, or non-profit
- Whether the recipient might be interested
- Whether it's "just once"

**Without consent = spam.**
